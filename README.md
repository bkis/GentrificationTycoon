# GENTRIFICATION TYCOON

Take from the poor - give to the rich.

The aim of the game is to make the player understand the process of gentrification by making them control an exemplary gentrification scenario having some fun on the way. There's roughly 1 hour of play time - depending on how clever your strategy is. Saving the game is not possible.

Gentrification Tycoon gives you three million dollars and the opportunity to exploit the mechanisms of gentrification to make your bank account grow and - in the end - succeed gentrifying an entire district to win the game.
You are a greedy real estate agent trying to get rid of the poor and attract the rich to turn an ugly industrial district into a luxurious money machine. Build Clubs to attract students, schools to attract families and art galleries to attract those extra fancy people. Build more classy houses and add some bling to them: Bathtub? Cable TV? Boring! Mahagony Floor? Sauna? Now we're talking! Only a few will be able to pay that, but that's what you want, right?

But be careful! Gentrification is not just about offering the most luxurious stuff to wealthy people. It's a slow process of subtle change in the demographic structure. No banker wants to live in this industrial dirt hole!
